# DOTPRINT3RInterface
GUI for the DOT PRINT3R EV3 robot

## What is this?
This is a WPF application used to prepare images for the DOT PRINT3R robot that will be showcased on Wroclaw University of Technology Academic High School's open days. It converts normal image files to a special format, which is interpreted by a driver on the EV3.

The app will also allow you to tweak the image to your liking, by editing pixels or applying basic filters to the image.
