# DOTPRINT3RInterface
GUI for the DOT PRINT3R EV3 robot

## What is this?
This is a WPF application used to prepare images for the DOT PRINT3R robot that was showcased on Wroclaw University of Technology Academic High School's open days. It converts normal image files to a special format, which is interpreted by a driver on the EV3.

The app also allows you to tweak the image to your liking, by editing pixels or applying basic filters to the image.
